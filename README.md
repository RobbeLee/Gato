# About
GATO is here to take the pressure off of everyday social media usage. Modern day social media websites are very busy and have many options. We believe that there are too many and that is why we created GATO. GATO is a simply designed websites where you can follow your friends and save the posts that you like.

# Likes
There is something special aboout our liking system. The special thing is that we don't show likes. You can like a post to save it for later but to make GATO an easy-going and wholesome we have decided not to show the amount. The amount of likes can also put a pressure on the uploader. We want you to upload because you want to, not because you feel that you need.
