        <h1> About GATO </h1>
        <p> With this page we hope to explain to you who we are, what we do, what this site is and what we hope to achieve. </p><br>
        <div class="whatIsThisSite">
            <h2>What is this site?</h2>
            <p>With Gato we hope to build a site that's easy to navigate and use. We see many social media platforms
                That are just impossible to use. <br>They are busy and often have annoying popups. Here at Gato we see this
                and get a little frustrated about it, we will offer you a place where you just come to share a photo and
                look at the photo's of your friends.<br> Nothing more, nothing less. This way we can offer you minimalistic design
                that is easy to use and navigate.</p> <br><br>
